# Interacting with the REPL 🚀

A REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) is an environment where user inputs are read, evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user in an infinite loop. <br>

In Bonsai; `garden dev` is a REPL that allows you to continously interact with Garden resources without ever leaving your terminal.

## Running tests 🏃🏻‍♀️

From this terminal you can run commands like `test unit-vote`{{exec}} which will allow you to run a Unit test defined in our voting app.

## Help 🆘

In case you need commands that are available for you simply type `help`{{exec}} and that will give you back a list of commands you can run inside the REPL.

If you encounter any other issues please don't hesitate to report in our [Discord Community](https://go.garden.io/discord).
